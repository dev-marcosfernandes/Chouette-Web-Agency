Project created while I was doing my internship as a student of OpenClassrooms.

In this project, I had to rebuild a website to make it more modern and also to reinforce the SEO performance.

In this repository, you will also find my SEO performance guidelines for a better activity. 

This website was entirely created based on a responsive design approach. 

I am happy to share it with all the Github comunity!
